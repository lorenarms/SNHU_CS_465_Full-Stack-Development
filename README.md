Course Description
</h2>
<p>Students will design and develop a full stack application through the utilization of programming language frameworks. In creating a full stack application, students will also be responsible for developing a database as well as the code that interfaces their application to the database. 
</p>
<p>
This course covers the following competencies, which represent the knowledge and skills relevant to your field:
<ul>
    <li>CS-30427: Design the architecture of a web application

<h3>My Project</h3>
<p>This class focused on the development of a single web application using the MEAN stack process (MongoDB, express.js framework, Angular frontend framework, and node.js backend server framework). The entire project was designed as a travel website, "Travlr Getaways", and can be found <a href="https://github.com/lorenarms/SNHU_CS_465_Full-Stack-Development/tree/main/CS-465%20Travlr" target="_blank"> in this folder</a>. 
This was a very challenging, very interesting, and very <i>very</i> fun project for me to work on. I enjoy web development more than any other type of project, so this class and application being the culmination of all my learning was just too perfect.

This project went through several design changes as it was developed, but the wireframe was the main guide to get to the finished product.</p>

<p>
In order to create a project similar to the one above you'll need a few things installed on your machine. First, I used <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank"> VS Code </a>, but just about any IDE will do (Code works best for projects like this, in my opinion). You'll need to install <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_intro.asp" target="_blank"> node.js </a>, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/express-js/" target="_blank"> express </a>, the <a href="https://angular.io/guide/setup-local" target="_blank"> Angular CLI </a>, and some sort of local database software. This project uses <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mongodb-an-introduction/" target="_blank"> MongoDB </a>, which can be installed alongside Compass, the UI for the local database. I made a video about how to install that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dj3yQAd6cAM" target="_blank"> here </a>.
